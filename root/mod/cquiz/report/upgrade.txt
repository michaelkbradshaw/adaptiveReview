This files describes API changes for cquiz report plugins.

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Quiz_reports


=== 2.3 ===

* Support for the old way of doing cron in a separate cron.php file has been removed.
Instead, you need a lib.php file inside the plugin with a cron function
called cquiz_myreportname_cron(). The statistics report is an example of how
it should be done.

* There was a big refactor of the cquiz reports, in issues MDL-32300, MDL-32322 and MDL-3030.
It is difficult to explain the changes. Probably the best way to understand what
happened is to look at
    git log mod/cquiz/report/overview
    git log mod/cquiz/report/responses
and so on. Here are some notes on a few of the changes:

The class cquiz_attempt_report was renamed to cquiz_attempts_report (with an extra s).

Some globally defined constants with the prefix CQUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ moved into
the cquiz_attempts_report class. Specifically

cquiz_attempts_report::ALL_WITH         replaces CQUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL
cquiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_ALL     replaces CQUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL_STUDENTS
cquiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITH    replaces CQUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH
cquiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITHOUT replaces CQUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH_NO

Your if you have a table class, it needs to be renamed like
cquiz_report_myreportname_table -> cquiz_myreportname_table. That is, all the
class names in your plugin should start with the frankenstyle plugin name
cquiz_myreportname.


=== 2.2 ===

* Plugins should be converted to implement cron in the standard way. In lib.php,
define a
function cquiz_myreportname_cron() {};
This replaces the old way of having a separate cron.php file. Also, the cron
frequency should be defined in version.php, not in the cquiz_reports table.


=== earlier versions ===

* ... API changes were not documented properly. Sorry. (There weren't many!)
